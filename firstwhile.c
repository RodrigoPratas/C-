//Write a program that reads from the keyboard a sequence of integers (number by number) and
//end with a letter, any letter stops the sequence, use while( (scanf(“%d”, &n))==1 ) and calculate:
//1.1 How many numbers were read;
//1.2 Which is the last largest and in what relative position within the read sequence it is found.
//1.3 Total sign changes from positive number to negative number;
//1.4 How many read numbers form the first largest increasing subsequence;
